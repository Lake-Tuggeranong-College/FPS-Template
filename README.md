# FPS-Template
 
This template was designed for Godot v3.x and is intended to be used as a starting point for creating a first-person shooter game. It includes a player character with basic movement and camera controls, a weapon system with a simple gun, and a basic enemy AI system. The template is fully customizable and can be easily expanded upon to create a more complex game.
